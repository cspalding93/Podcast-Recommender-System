## Project Introduction
Recommender systems are used across all markets in order to drive sales and maintain repeat customers. Amazon is often one of the first examples of a company that knows how to implement a recommender system, but recommenders are used amongst almost any company look to retain user engagement or sell more products. For an example on how important a recommender system is to a company: Back in 2009, [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) awarded a small group of programmers and data scientists a million dollar grand prize for improvement on their recommender system based on user ratings. The final product was an improvement by 10% more predictive power of who would watch a recommended item. Recommenders effect not just what is being presented, but how it is presented in the application. The goal of any good recommender system is to “Help members find content to watch and enjoy to maximize member [user](https://www.slideshare.net/moustaki/some-pitfalls-of-distributed-learning) satisfaction and retention” (quoted)
